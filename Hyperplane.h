// Hyperplane
//
// An (n-1)-dimensional hyperplane orthogonal to a given normal vector N,
// located at the signed offset -b/‖N‖ from the origin.
//
// This class follows the convention originally set by Ludwig Otto Hesse, with respect to
// the signed distance. The Hesse form (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse_normal_form) of
// a hyperplane is where N is a unit normal vector (‖N‖ is one), indicated by giving N a hat,
// and reads:
//     ∧
//     N·X = ρ
//
// Here ρ is the signed offset of the plane from the origin: ρ is positive iff
// the plane lies in the direction that the normal points:
//
//              hyperplane
//                 |
//          N      |  N
//        O---->   |---->
//     origin      |
//                 P----------->A
//        -------->|  S(A) > 0
//           ρ > 0 |
//
// However, the signed distance S(A) from the plane to a point A is relative to the plane
// itself and positive if A is on the side of the plane that N is pointing towards
// (e.g. https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.036/spring_2016/assignments/hw0_final.pdf (2d)).
//
// Let a point A be given by its projection P onto the plane and its signed distance s from
// the plane:
//               ∧
//     A = P + s N
//                                                 ∧
// Then the signed distance of A to the hyperplane N·X - ρ = 0 is:
//            ∧         ∧        ∧         ∧            ∧ ∧
//     S(A) = N·A - ρ = N·(P + s N) - ρ = (N·P - ρ) + s N·N = s
//
// because P is in the plane.
//
// Note that the signed distance of the origin itself is:
//            ∧
//     S(O) = N·O - ρ = -ρ,
//
// and has the opposite sign of the plane offset!
//
//              hyperplane
//                 |
//                 |  N
//     origin      |---->
//        O<-------Q-.         ∧
//            /    |  \_ Q = ρ·N
//   S(O) = -ρ < 0 |
//
// The constructor of this class is accepts the normal vector N (not necessarily
// a unit vector) as first argument and the negative of the dot product of N with
// some point P in the plane (b = -N·P).
//
// Note that in the literature it is common to write the equation of a hyperplane as:
//
//     N·X + b = 0,
//
// Hyperplane also stores N and b.
//
// Because P is in the plane, we have N·P + b = 0 --> b = -N·P.
// If we write the plane equation in Hesse form, by dividing by ‖N‖,
//
//     (N·X + b)/‖N‖ = 0 -> (N/‖N‖)·X = -b/‖N‖
//
// we see that b = -ρ ‖N‖, the plane offset multiplied by -‖N‖.
//
// Note:
// * The signed offset of the plane from the origin is ρ = -b/‖N‖.
//              ∧
// * The point ρN = (-b/‖N‖)(N/‖N‖) = (-b/‖N‖²)N is the projection of the origin onto the hyperplane.
//
// * The perpendicular distance between the origin and the plane is |ρ| = |b|/‖N‖.
//
// * The signed distance of the origin from the plane is -ρ = b/‖N‖.
